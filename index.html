                        Juicing can play a role in a balanced diet. For instance, it can help you get fruits and vegetables if you don't enjoy eating them.

                        Juicing also can give the digestive system a rest from digesting fiber. This may help some people who have certain health conditions or who receive certain medical treatments. Do not cut back on fiber unless a health care professional recommends it. Fiber is key for digestive health, and it can help you feel full.

                    Organic products reduce public health risks to farm workers, their families, and consumers by minimizing their exposure to toxic and persistent chemicals on the farm and in food, the soil in which they work and play, the air they breathe, and the water they drink. Children are especially vulnerable to pesticides. Thus, offering organic food and fiber products into the marketplace gives parents the option of choosing products produced without the use of these toxins.
